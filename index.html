          I started my journey graduating as a Mechanical Engineer, however I
          always wanted to continue my education. I started with learning about
          python through a coursera course which has set good foundational
          knoweldge. Recently, I have decieded to fully dedicate my time to
          coding and learning as much as I can to be able to venture into the
          tech world. I am starting with HTML, and CSS and about to being
          learning JavaScript. The other side of me is also interested in
          working out, video games, travelling and skiing.
